    <p align="Centers" <b><fontcolor="#1BF804"><b>THE ORIGIN OF SPECIAL LIBRARY</p></fontcolor></b>

   <p> Special library may be define as A special library is a library that provides specialized information resources on a particular subject, serves a specialized and limited clientele, and delivers specialized services to that clientele.<br>[1] Special libraries include corporate libraries, government libraries, law libraries, medical libraries, museum libraries, news libraries, and nonprofit libraries. Special libraries also exist within academic institutions, including law school libraries and medical school libraries. These libraries are included as special libraries because they are often funded separately from the rest of the university and they serve a targeted group of users
                In 20th century with the development of industrial, technological and scientific advances the concept of special libraries came in to existence. <br>The growing need for specialized information further development and research came to play a vital role in the expansion of special libraries.
                Special Library is a library, which collects updated and comprehensive information on the subject concerned with the parent organization and disseminates this information promptly to the people associated with the organization on demand and in anticipation. <br>Besides this, one other factor is that a special library develops its major collection on some special subject or field.
    The Function of Special Library</p>
    
   <p> 1.	It selects and procures documents and other sources of relevant information;</p>
    <p>2.	It processes the procured information or documents with the help of classification, cataloguing, shelf arrangements etc. to make them easily available for the users</p>
        <p>3.	It subscribes to a good number of journals related to its area</p>
            <p>4.	It provides indexing and abstracting services to the users to save their time</p>
                <p>5.	It provides reference services to the users by telephone, by post or by email; It gives current awareness service (CAS) regarding new arrivals and latest services to the users</p>
                    <p>6.	It provides Selective Dissemination of Information (SDI) services to the users as per their subject interest and requirement; It also gives document delivery service to its user</p>
                        <p>7.	It brings out library bulletins weekly/ fortnightly/ monthly to keep the users up to date with latest information</p>
                            <p>8.	It gives translation services to provide the desired information to the users in their convenient language</p>
                                <p>9.	It also provides internet as well as internet facility to the users in order to access the library collection and catalogue at their desktop; It responds to the reference queries and make retrospective search of literature as per users demand</p>
                                    <p>10.	It compiles bibliographies, union catalogues, documentation lists, newspaper-clippings; accession lists etc. to save the time of its users; and It provides inter library loan facility to the users.</p>
    
    
    
    
    <p><b>OBJECTIVES OF SPECIAL LIBRARY</b>></p>
    
   <p> The main objectives of a special library are as follows:</p>
   <p> 1.	It serves the information needs of its parent body.</p>
    <p>2.	It disseminates updated and significant information in the concerned field;</p>
    <p>3.	It gives pinpointed information promptly;</p>
    <p>4.	It provides desired information to its users on demand and mostly in anticipation;</p>
    <p>5.	The users also get new ideas and inspiration to initiate new projects.</p>
    
    <p><b>THE PROBLEM OF SPECIAL LIBRARY</b></p>
    <p> 1.	Special libraries can be a dynamic environment in which to work, but, like many library sectors, special libraries are struggling to find their place, to establish their territory and define their services in a new information world.
        <p>2.	Inadequate manpower</p>
            <p> 3.	Inadequate ICT facilities, </p>
                <p> 4.	Outdated collection,</p>
                    <p> 5.	 Poor maintenance culture,</p>
                        <p>6.	 Negligence by managements etc.</p>
                            <p> 7.	Another challenge facing special libraries is the view that ‘everything is on the internet, why do we need a library anymore?’ This is actually a challenge for all library sectors, but more so for special libraries where the existence of a library is perhaps not as secure</p>
                                <p>8.	Finally, there is the challenge for special librarians to step back and see themselves first and foremost as employees of the wider organization and second as librarians. They must continue to look for ways in which the library and information service can assist the business or organization achieve its goals and objectives.</p>
    
    
                                    <p> The Funding of Special Library</p>
                                        <p> 	Special libraries are funded by their parent institutions. Some special libraries make material available through inter-library loan, and some allow usage and borrowing. In most cases, special library materials are available only to specific users, and borrowing and usage are governed strictly by individual policies.</p>
    
                                            <p> 	The funding and resources afforded to a special library are often directly related to the success and financial position of its parent company or organization. Many special libraries are a support service. </p>
    
                                                <p><b>LIBRARY ACHIEVEMENT</b></p>
    Library staffs are being trained on all aspects of ICT such as digitization of library resources, web blogging, web mastery, website design, wikis, etc. In addition, the present University Library Administration ensured that every professional librarian now has a PC on his/her table or one to work with.</p>
    Characteristics
    <p> 	Special libraries often have a more specific clientele than libraries in traditional educational or public settings, and deal with more specialized kinds of information</p>
        <p> 	They are developed to support the mission of their sponsoring organization and their collections and services are more targeted and specific to the needs of their clientele.</p>
            <p> 	Special libraries may or may not be open to the general public. Those that are open to the public may offer services similar to research, reference, public, academic, or children's libraries, often with restrictions such as only lending books to patients at a hospital or restricting the public from parts of a military collection</p>
                <p> 	 They are generally staffed by librarians, although many librarians employed in special libraries are specialists in the library's field rather than generally trained librarians, and often are not required to have advanced degrees in specifically library-related field due to the specialized content and clientele of the library</p>

<p>TRUST AND OBEY</p>
              <p>1.	When we walk with the lord<br>
In the light of his word<br>
What a glory he sheds on our way<br>
While we do his good will,<br>
He abides with us still<br>
And with all who will trust and obey</p>
<p> Chorus:	Trust and Obey<br>
		For there is no other way<br>
		To be happy in Jesus<br>
		But to trust and obey</p>

        <p>2.	Not a burden we bear,
Not a sorrow we shear<br>
But our toil he doth richly repay<br>
Not a grief or a loss<br>
Not a frown or a cross<br>
But is blest if we trust and obey</p>

<p>3.	But we never can prove
Delights of his love<br>
Until all on the altar we lay<br>
For the favor he shows<br>
And the joy he bestow<br>
Are for them who will trust and obey</p>

<p>4.	Then in fellowship sweet<br>
We will seat at his feet<br>
Or we will walk by his side in the way<br>
What he says we will do<br>
Where he sends we will go<br>
Never fear only trust and obey</p>
